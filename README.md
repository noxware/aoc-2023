## About

This repo contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) written in Rust.

## Repo format example

- `d1.txt` is the input for day 1.
- `d1p1.rs` is the binary for day 1 part 1.
- `d1p2a1.rs` is another (alternative 1) solution for day 1 part 2.

## Running a solution

To run a solution use `cargo run --bin d1p1` for day 1 part 1.
